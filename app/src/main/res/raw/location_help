Positional shows you 5 different aspects of your location: coordinates, accuracy, bearing,
elevation, and speed.

_Positional does not calculate any of these; it simply asks Google Play
Services and your Android device for them, then displays them to you as they flow in. They are
discarded by the app instantly without being recorded._

### Coordinates
Your current position, e.g. latitude and longitude. You can adjust the format for this in Settings.
The following formats are available:

- Decimal degrees
- Degrees with decimal minutes
- Degrees, minutes, and seconds
- MGRS
- UTM

These coordinates are determined using a "fused" approach, using data from various sources like GNSS
(e.g. GPS, Galileo, BDS, GLONASS, IRNSS, or QZSS), cell towers, and WiFi networks.

### Accuracy
The accuracy of the coordinates above. This varies depending on the coordinates source (for more
info about sources, see above) and the current environment your Android device is located in. For
example, when you're outside with a clear view of the sky, you'll most likely have great GPS
reception and see great accuracies. When you're deep inside of a building surrounded by concrete,
steel, or other materials that interfere with GPS, cell, and WiFi signals, you'll most likely have
poor reception and see worse accuracies.

### Bearing
The direction you are moving, regardless of orientation of your Android device. To minimize
distraction, speed and bearing are not shown when speed is 0.3 m/s (roughly 0.67 mph) or lower. This
is because accuracies are often poor enough for devices to think they are moving when they are not.

### Elevation
Your current elevation above the WGS-84 ellipsoid (a rough approximation of Earth's surface).

### Speed
Your current ground speed (not air speed). To minimize distraction, speed and bearing are not shown
when speed is 0.3 m/s (roughly 0.67 mph) or lower. This is because accuracies are often poor enough
for devices to think they are moving when they are not.

If your device is running Android 8.0 or higher, Positional will also show you accuracies for each
of these aspects. You can hide these accuracies in Settings.

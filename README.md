# Positional
Minimalist, private, free, and open source Android app for location, compass, and solar times

## What does the app do?

- Get your location's coordinates or export them to a map
- Find your direction with the digital compass
- Check various solar times for any given day

It's that simple.

## Free? Open source?

Yup. It's free and open source because I think it provides such basic information that everyone
should have access to it without compromising their privacy. Everything in the app is free. I
might add some donation functionality later, but we'll see. I just enjoy slowly crafting this in
my spare time and hope you all can enjoy it, too :)

## Is it private?

Absolutely. There are only two things this app collects and both are used very simply:

1. Your location is collected, shown to you in app, and immediately discarded. If you choose
to export or share it, the app helps you do so.
2. Crash diagnostics are collected completely anonymously to help me debug and fix the app
when it breaks.

## I have a feature request or bug report!
Great! I encourage you to create an issue here in the GitHub repo so others can see and 
contribute to the discussion, but feel free to shoot me an email at trewartha.mike@gmail.com,
too.

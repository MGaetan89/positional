## Privacy Policy
Positional is a free and open-source app, offered for use as is. This document details data collection and usage by the app.

### Data Collection
Positional only directly collects one piece of information about you or your device: location. This is the core function of the
app. As such, it requests your location from Google Play Services. Once Google Play Services provides the location to
Positional, the app displays it, then discards it. Your privacy is highly valued, so the location of your device is never
stored or sent to anyone or anywhere- it is solely for displaying to you.

Positional does not directly collect any additional information about you or your device. However, it does use some third-party
services offered by Google in order to help the developers create a better experience for users. See the section below for more
details.

### Third-Party Services
Positional makes use of several third-party services in order to help the developers improve your experience in the app. These
services include:

- **Firebase Crashlytics** gathers information related to any crashes that the app experiences.
- **Firebase Analytics** gathers information about how users in general use the app.
- **Firebase Performance** gathers performance related information, e.g. how quickly the app was able to determine your device's
location.

All of these services collect an "advertising identifier", which is an identifier that is unique to every individual install of
Positional. The identifier is not tied to any personal information.

### Questions or Concerns?
If you have any concerns regarding this policy or your privacy, please do not hesitate to get in touch. You can
create a GitHub issue at https://github.com/miketrewartha/positional or you can send an email to Mike Trewartha, the main
developer of the app, at trewartha.mike@gmail.com.

That's it :) Thank you for using Positional!
